With more controversy in the calls made by referees during crucial parts of the game, it is important to check whether referees are influenced by home crowds when making critical calls that can determine who wins. We can visualize this by analyzing the home team win percentage associated with every referee over their regular season games. Referees had to have officiated over 10 games to be on the list. Gerald Austin had a home team win percentage of around 73.3% in the 15 games he officiated, followed by Larry Nemers (64.9% in 131 games) and Ronald Torbert (63% in 46 games). The referee with the lowest home win percentage is Scott Novak with a win percentage of 37.9% for home teams over 30 games. All data can be found on the .png file in the repository.

From what we can tell from this data, there does seem to be more referees with a home win percentage over 50%. However, there could be more factors that contribute to this so no conclusions could be drawn. Although there is no clear indication for referee bias for home teams, this trend over all referees does warrant more investigation on how referees are impacted by the home crowd when making calls.
